## How does it work?
This transition uses an Alpha Test shader and attempts to replicate retro GameBoy-style Pokemon battle transitions.
Most transition-related files are in the transitions directory:

### [Transitions Directory](scenes/transition)
 - [Transition shader](scenes/transition/Transition.shader)
 - [Transition sprite](scenes/transition/TexRect.gd)
 - [Transition scene](scenes/transition/Transition.gd)
